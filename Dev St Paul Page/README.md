# Dynamic Web Application

## Implement the following to earn 45/60 points (grade: C)

 - [ ] Show a map using the Leaflet API

    - [X] Pan and zoom available with mouse click-and-drag and scroll wheel interaction
    - [X] Limit pan and zoom so map does not display regions outside of St. Paul
        HINT: zoom levels 11-18 are good
        NOTE: this is already the default setup in the starter code!
    - [X] Have an input box and 'Go' button for a user to type a location (lat/  long coordinates, address, etc.)
    - [ ] Implement the method that will use the searchbox to update the map
    - [ ] Map should update when location is entered and 'Go' button pressed
    - [ ] Input box text should update with new location (lat/long coordinates or address) when map is panned/zoomed
        - NOTE: updating once pan/zoom has ended is recommended - constantly updating this during a pan will overwhelm the system
    - [ ] Use the Nominatim API (https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/ to convert between address and lat/long
    - [ ] Clamp input values if lat/long is outside of St. Paul's bounding box
- [ ] Retrieve data from your St. Paul Crime API
    - [ ] By default, include 1,000 most recent crimes in the database
    - [ ] Populate a table with one row per crime (use neighborhood_name rather than neighborhood_number, and incident_type rather than code)
        - [ ] Table should be ordered with most recent on top 
        - [ ] Only show crimes that occurred in neighborhoods visible on the map
            - HINT: get lat/long coordinates for the NW and SE corners of the map to use as the min/max lat/long coordinates
        - [ ] Draw markers on the map for each neighborhood
            - [ ] Marker should have popup to show the number of crimes committed in that neighborhood
    - [ ] New Incident upload form
        - [X] Create a user input form for users to add a new crime incident to the database (i.e. submit the PUT request)
        - [X] Ensure all fields are filled out before submitting request, otherwise show some error message
        - [ ] Set up API PUT call so data makes it to the database
    - [ ] "About the Project" page
        - [ ] Short bio about each team member (including a photo)
        Description of the tools (frameworks, APIs, etc.) you used to create the application
        - [ ] Video demo of the application (2 - 4 minutes) - include voiceover
            Can natively embed or upload to YouTube and embed
        - [ ] Six interesting findings that you discovered using your application
- [] Fill out dependencies in Package.json

## Implement additional features to earn a B or A (5 pts each)

- [ ] Create UI controls to filter crime data
    - [ ] Filter based on the following
            - [ ] incident_type: list of checkboxes per incident_type
                OK (in fact recommended) to aggregate similar incident types (e.g. codes 1800 - 1885 are all sub-categories of 'Narcotics')
            - [ ] neighborhood_name: list of checkboxes per neighborhood_name
            date range: select a start and end date (only show crimes between those dates)
            - [ ] time range: select a start and end time (only show crimes that occurred between those times of day)
            - [ ] max incidents: select maximum number of incidents to retrieve / show
        - [ ] Changing a filter should trigger a new request to the St. Paul Crime API
            - It's OK to have a separate 'Update' button, so users can change many filters before triggering a new request
    - [ ] Style the background color of rows in the table to categorize crimes as "violent crimes" (crimes against another person), "property crimes" (crimes against a person's or business' property), or "other crimes" (anything else)
        - [ ] You can categorize as you see fit - here's a link with more info to help though: https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/ 
    - [ ] Also include a legend for the colors

- [ ] Add a 'delete' button for each crime in the table
    - Clicking this button should submit a DELETE request to remove the incident from the database

- [ ] Add a marker to the map at exact crime location when selected from the table
    - [ ] Make marker a different color / icon than the markers for the total crimes per neighborhood
    - [ ] Create a popup with date, time, incident, and delete button
    Note addresses are slightly obscured (e.g. '98X UNIVERSITY AV W' or 'THOMAS AV & VICTORIA')
        - [ ] For addresses with an 'X' in the address number, you can replace it with a '0' (e.g. '90X UNIVERSITY AV W' would become '980 UNIVERSITY AV W'). Careful not to replace all X's though - there could be an X in the street name!

- [ ] Format Badge Image to right size
